# Customize-Virtual-File-System(CVFS)Project

> This project is the virtual representation of file system.
> File system is considered as the way of storing the information about file and data from the file into the secondary storage device.
> Every operating system as its own type of file system (NTFS, FAT32, FAT16,UFS).
> In this project, I implement the layout of complete file system from Harddisk,RAM.
> In this project, I implement almost every related system call used in the file manipulation activity along with some important commands.
> This is a research based project. I developed this project to understand internals of an operating system and to explore the data structure implementation of C programming.
